I would like to thank my supervisor for his fantastic enthusiasm and help with writing this thesis. He has been available on a weekly basis and has shown a keen interest in following up this thesis. The thesis would not have taken the direction that it has without his contributions.

Huge thanks to the Western Norway Research Institute and its Teknol√∏ft Sogn og Fjordane initiative  for their support throughout the spring of 2022. They have been very helpful in allowing me to focus on the thesis while also employing me during this spring. In the forefront of the institute i would like to especially mention Rajendra Akerkar for his patience and support. I am very happy and proud to have the Western Norway Research Institute as my employer.

And lastly, I would like to thank family and friends for their support through a spring which has been demanding for me in regards to different private matters. Of utmost importance is my partner, Brita Lie Lysne, without her support I would most certainly not have been able to complete my exchange studies in Sweden. She has through her love, support and patience helped ensure that this thesis would be completed in due time.

To all of you, you have my deepest gratitude.
